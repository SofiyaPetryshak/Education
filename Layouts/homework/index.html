            The certification process involves rigorous training for staff,
            inspections and improvements that enable Space Center Houston to
            better welcome and accommodate guests with autism spectrum disorder
            and other sensory and cognitive challenges. Space Center Houston was
            always welcoming to guests with special needs,” McMahon said. “I was
            able to help support that commitment by leading informal training
            for my instructor colleagues on working with guests with
            disabilities, including autism.
